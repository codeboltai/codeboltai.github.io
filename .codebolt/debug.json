[{"threadId":"b33b3a10-5a99-47ec-af8f-65f5cb1dd174","task":{"full":true,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are Codebolt Dev, a highly skilled software developer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.\nundefined\n====\n \nCAPABILITIES\n\n- You can read and analyze code in various programming languages, and can write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.\n- You can debug complex issues and providing detailed explanations, offering architectural insights and design patterns.\n- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files in a directory (top level or recursively), extract source code definitions, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.\n- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current working directory ('/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current working directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n- You can use search_files to perform regex searches across files in a specified directory, outputting context-rich results that include surrounding lines. This is particularly useful for understanding code patterns, finding specific implementations, or identifying areas that need refactoring.\n- You can use the list_code_definition_names tool to get an overview of source code definitions for all files at the top level of a specified directory. This can be particularly useful when you need to understand the broader context and relationships between certain parts of the code. You may need to call this tool multiple times to understand various parts of the codebase related to the task.\n\t- For example, when asked to make edits or improvements you might analyze the file structure in the initial environment_details to get an overview of the project, then use list_code_definition_names to get further insight using source code definitions for files located in relevant directories, then read_file to examine the contents of relevant files, analyze the code and suggest improvements or make necessary edits, then use the write_to_file tool to implement changes. If you refactored code that could affect other parts of the codebase, you could use search_files to ensure you update other files as needed.\n- The execute_command tool lets you run commands on the user's computer and should be used whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.\n\n====\n\nRULES\n\n- Your current working project is: /Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo\n- Blank Project is already created keep this in mind\n- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.\n- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.\n- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of '/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.\n- When using the search_files tool, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user's task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using write_to_file to make informed changes.\n- When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when writing files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.\n- You must try to use multiple tools in one request when possible. For example if you were to create a website, you would use the write_to_file tool to create the necessary files with their appropriate contents all at once. Or if you wanted to analyze a project, you could use the read_file tool multiple times to look at several key files. This will help you accomplish the user's task more efficiently.\n- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.\n- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.\n- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.\n- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.\n- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.\n- NEVER end completion_attempt with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. \n- NEVER start your responses with affirmations like \"Certainly\", \"Okay\", \"Sure\", \"Great\", etc. You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point.\n- Feel free to use markdown as much as you'd like in your responses. When using code blocks, always include a language specifier.\n- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.\n- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.\n- CRITICAL: When editing files with write_to_file, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content in your response. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Partial updates or placeholders like '// rest of code unchanged' are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or broken code, severely impacting the user's project.\n- Do not use the 'open' command to run the project. Instead, use 'npx http-server' to serve static HTML files.\n====\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.\n2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. It is okay for certain steps to take multiple iterations, i.e. if you need to create many files but are limited by your max output limitations, it's okay to create a few files at a time as each subsequent iteration will keep you informed on the work completed and what's remaining. \n3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Then, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Next, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user. You may also provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your task; this can be particularly useful for web development tasks, where you can run e.g. `open index.html` to show the website you've built.\n5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.\n\n====\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nOperating System: Darwin\nDefault Shell: \nHome Directory: /Users/ravirawat\nCurrent Working Directory: /Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<task>\ncreate tic tac toe  game #CodeBolt Dev \n\n\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n(No visible files)\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n(No open tabs)\n\n# Current Working Directory (/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo) Files\n.codeboltconfig\n.codeboltconfig.yaml\n.gitignore\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_1zEhu5AVNYpX9QzyGWVU94We","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/index.html\",\"content\":\"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n    <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\">\\n    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>\\n    <link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"style.css\\\">\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n    <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>\\n    <div class=\\\"board\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"0\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"6\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"7\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"8\\\"></div>\\n    </div>\\n    <script src=\\\"script.js\\\"></script>\\n</body>\\n</html>\"}"}}]},{"role":"tool","tool_call_id":"call_1zEhu5AVNYpX9QzyGWVU94We","content":"The content was successfully saved to tic-tac-toe/index.html."},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n(No visible files)\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n(No open tabs)\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_ygB6wFu8r1jnQSYSsxq1Mgs3","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/style.css\",\"content\":\"body {\\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\n    display: flex;\\n    flex-direction: column;\\n    align-items: center;\\n    justify-content: center;\\n    height: 100vh;\\n    margin: 0;\\n    background-color: #f4f4f4;\\n}\\n\\nh1 {\\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n.board {\\n    display: grid;\\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);\\n    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);\\n    gap: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n.cell {\\n    width: 100px;\\n    height: 100px;\\n    background-color: #fff;\\n    display: flex;\\n    align-items: center;\\n    justify-content: center;\\n    font-size: 2em;\\n    cursor: pointer;\\n    border: 2px solid #333;\\n}\"}"}},{"id":"call_BYEJCyF8R3wKjRE8JqF9jvSz","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/script.js\",\"content\":\"const board = document.querySelector('.board');\\nconst cells = document.querySelectorAll('.cell');\\nlet currentPlayer = 'X';\\nlet boardState = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];\\n\\nfunction handleCellClick(event) {\\n    const cell = event.target;\\n    const index = cell.dataset.index;\\n\\n    if (boardState[index] === '' && !checkWinner()) {\\n        boardState[index] = currentPlayer;\\n        cell.textContent = currentPlayer;\\n\\n        if (checkWinner()) {\\n            alert(currentPlayer + ' wins!');\\n            resetBoard();\\n        } else if (!boardState.includes('')) {\\n            alert('Draw!');\\n            resetBoard();\\n        }\\n\\n        currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 'X' ?

Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.\n- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.\n- CRITICAL: When editing files with write_to_file, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content in your response. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Partial updates or placeholders like '// rest of code unchanged' are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or broken code, severely impacting the user's project.\n- Do not use the 'open' command to run the project. Instead, use 'npx http-server' to serve static HTML files.\n====\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.\n2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. It is okay for certain steps to take multiple iterations, i.e. if you need to create many files but are limited by your max output limitations, it's okay to create a few files at a time as each subsequent iteration will keep you informed on the work completed and what's remaining. \n3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Then, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Next, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user. You may also provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your task; this can be particularly useful for web development tasks, where you can run e.g. `open index.html` to show the website you've built.\n5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.\n\n====\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nOperating System: Darwin\nDefault Shell: \nHome Directory: /Users/ravirawat\nCurrent Working Directory: /Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<task>\ncreate tic tac toe  game #CodeBolt Dev \n\n\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n(No visible files)\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n(No open tabs)\n\n# Current Working Directory (/Users/ravirawat/Documents/codebolt/separate-indigo) Files\n.codeboltconfig\n.codeboltconfig.yaml\n.gitignore\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_1zEhu5AVNYpX9QzyGWVU94We","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/index.html\",\"content\":\"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n    <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\">\\n    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>\\n    <link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"style.css\\\">\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n    <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>\\n    <div class=\\\"board\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"0\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"6\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"7\\\"></div>\\n        <div class=\\\"cell\\\" data-index=\\\"8\\\"></div>\\n    </div>\\n    <script src=\\\"script.js\\\"></script>\\n</body>\\n</html>\"}"}}]},{"role":"tool","tool_call_id":"call_1zEhu5AVNYpX9QzyGWVU94We","content":"The content was successfully saved to tic-tac-toe/index.html."},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n(No visible files)\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n(No open tabs)\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_ygB6wFu8r1jnQSYSsxq1Mgs3","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/style.css\",\"content\":\"body {\\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\n    display: flex;\\n    flex-direction: column;\\n    align-items: center;\\n    justify-content: center;\\n    height: 100vh;\\n    margin: 0;\\n    background-color: #f4f4f4;\\n}\\n\\nh1 {\\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n.board {\\n    display: grid;\\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);\\n    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);\\n    gap: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n.cell {\\n    width: 100px;\\n    height: 100px;\\n    background-color: #fff;\\n    display: flex;\\n    align-items: center;\\n    justify-content: center;\\n    font-size: 2em;\\n    cursor: pointer;\\n    border: 2px solid #333;\\n}\"}"}},{"id":"call_BYEJCyF8R3wKjRE8JqF9jvSz","type":"function","function":{"name":"write_to_file","arguments":"{\"path\":\"tic-tac-toe/script.js\",\"content\":\"const board = document.querySelector('.board');\\nconst cells = document.querySelectorAll('.cell');\\nlet currentPlayer = 'X';\\nlet boardState = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];\\n\\nfunction handleCellClick(event) {\\n    const cell = event.target;\\n    const index = cell.dataset.index;\\n\\n    if (boardState[index] === '' && !checkWinner()) {\\n        boardState[index] = currentPlayer;\\n        cell.textContent = currentPlayer;\\n\\n        if (checkWinner()) {\\n            alert(currentPlayer + ' wins!');\\n            resetBoard();\\n        } else if (!boardState.includes('')) {\\n            alert('Draw!');\\n            resetBoard();\\n        }\\n\\n        currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 'X' ?
