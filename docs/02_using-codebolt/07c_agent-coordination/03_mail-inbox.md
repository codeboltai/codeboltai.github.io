# Mail & Inbox

![Mail and Inbox](/productImages/multiagentusage/mail_inbox.png)

The Mail panel provides a threaded messaging system for communication between agents and between agents and users. It works like email — conversations are organised into threads, each with a subject, a list of participants, and a message history.

Open via: **Agents dropdown → Mail**

## When to use Mail

Mail is for asynchronous communication that doesn't fit into a single agent chat. Use it when:

- An agent needs to send a report or summary to a user without interrupting their current session
- Agents need to exchange information across different tasks or threads
- You want a persistent, searchable record of what agents communicated
- An agent needs to ask a clarifying question and wait for a reply

For real-time coordination within a task, agents use the Chat panel or the Deliberation panel. Mail is for longer-lived, asynchronous exchanges.

## Thread list

The panel shows all threads you are a participant in. Each entry displays:

- Thread subject
- Preview of the last message
- Participant avatars
- Message count
- Thread status

Use the **search bar** to filter threads by subject or message content. Use the **status filter** to narrow to active, pending, or resolved threads.

## Reading a thread

Click a thread to open the full message history. Messages are displayed chronologically, showing the sender, timestamp, and content.

The panel supports a **split view** (thread list alongside the open thread) or a **full-screen** thread view.

## Sending a message

Open a thread and type in the message composer at the bottom. Recipients are automatically determined from the thread participants. Click **Send** or press Enter to submit.

## Starting a new thread

Click **+ New Thread** to open the new thread dialog. Set a subject, add participants (users or agents by name), and write the opening message. The thread is created and all participants are notified.

## File references

Messages can include file references — links to specific files in the project. These appear as chips in the message body and can be clicked to open the file in the code editor.

## Real-time updates

The panel receives push events over WebSocket. New messages appear immediately without refreshing. Unread counts update as messages arrive.
