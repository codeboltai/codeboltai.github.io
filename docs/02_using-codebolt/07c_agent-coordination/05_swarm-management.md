# Swarm Management

A **swarm** is a named group of agents configured to work toward a shared goal. The Swarm Management panel lets you create swarms, assign roles, monitor their activity, and handle lifecycle requests like agent spawning and termination.

Open via: **Agents dropdown → Swarm Management**

## What a swarm is

A swarm groups agents under a shared configuration — a maximum agent count, defined roles, and a corresponding job group. Agents in a swarm coordinate through the Jobs panel (each swarm gets a dedicated job group prefixed `SWARM-{name}`) and through the other coordination tools.

## Creating a swarm

1. Click **+ New Swarm**
2. Enter a name and description
3. Set the maximum number of agents
4. Save

A corresponding job group is automatically created for the swarm.

## Swarm detail

Click a swarm to open its detail view. The detail view has several tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agents** | All agents currently in the swarm, with their status |
| **Roles** | Defined roles agents can fill within this swarm |
| **Teams** | Sub-groups within the swarm |
| **Vacancies** | Open positions waiting for agents to fill |
| **Config** | Swarm-level configuration (max agents, settings) |
| **Activity** | Event log of swarm-level actions |

## Spawn requests

When an agent within a swarm wants to spawn a sub-agent, the spawn request appears in the **Spawn Requests** panel for approval. The panel shows:

- Requesting agent
- Requested agent type
- Reason for the request
- Pending request count badge

Approve or reject each request individually.

## Termination requests

Similarly, **Termination Requests** shows agents that have requested to terminate themselves or another agent. Review and approve or reject before the termination proceeds.

## Role management

Define the roles available in a swarm — for example: `architect`, `reviewer`, `tester`. Agents can be assigned to roles, and jobs can require a specific role.

## Filtering and search

Filter swarms by active/inactive status and search by name or description.
