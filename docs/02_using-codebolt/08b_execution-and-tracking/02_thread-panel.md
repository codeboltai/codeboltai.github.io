# Thread Panel

The Thread Panel is a unified list of every message thread in the current project. Each chat conversation, agent run, and delegated sub-task creates a thread; the Thread Panel lets you navigate and monitor all of them from one place.

Open it via: **Execution dropdown → Thread Panel**

## What a thread is

A thread is the record of a single agent conversation — the user messages, agent replies, tool calls, and status updates that belong to one unit of work. Threads are created when:

- You start a new Chat tab
- An agent spawns a sub-agent (which gets its own thread)
- A hook or scheduled trigger starts an agent run

## Thread list

The Thread Panel shows all threads sorted by most-recently-active. Each row displays:

- **Agent icon + name** — which agent handled this thread
- **Thread title** — the first message or a generated summary
- **Status badge** — `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `paused`
- **Timestamp** — when the thread was last active

Click any thread to open the **Thread Detail** view, which shows the full message history for that thread — including sub-agent calls, tool results, and any streaming output.

## Thread Detail

The Thread Detail panel is a read-only replay of the thread. It shows:

- Every user message and agent reply
- Each tool call with its input and output
- Token counts per turn
- Errors and retries

Use Thread Detail to understand exactly what an agent did — especially useful when a run completed in the background and you want to review the full trace.

## Filtering threads

Use the search bar at the top of the Thread Panel to filter by:

- Thread title keyword
- Agent name
- Status (`running`, `completed`, `failed`)

## Thread status badges

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `running` | Agent is actively processing |
| `completed` | Agent finished successfully |
| `failed` | Agent encountered an unrecoverable error |
| `paused` | Agent is waiting for user input |
| `cancelled` | Run was manually stopped |

## Resuming a paused thread

When an agent needs clarification it can't resolve on its own, it pauses and marks the thread as `paused`. The thread row is highlighted in the Thread Panel. Click it → type your response → the agent resumes from where it stopped.

## Cleaning up

Right-click a completed thread → **Archive** to remove it from the active list. Archived threads are kept in history and can be searched from the Thread Panel's archive view.
