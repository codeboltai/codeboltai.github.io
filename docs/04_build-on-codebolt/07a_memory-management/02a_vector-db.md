# Vector DB

The Vector DB component manages collections of vector embeddings for semantic search across project files and arbitrary text. It is backed by SQLite with the `sqlite-vec` extension for K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) similarity search, and FTS5 for hybrid search that combines BM25 keyword scoring with vector similarity via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

## Storage Layout

### Database

All vector data lives in the shared project database:

```
{projectPath}/.codebolt/db/project.db
```

The database runs in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for concurrent read/write performance.

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vec_documents` | Stores documents — columns: `collection`, `uri`, `doc_text`, `hash`, `metadata` |
| `vec_chunks` | Stores chunks of documents — columns: `document_id`, `collection`, `chunk_text`, `start_pos`, `end_pos` |
| `vec_collections` | Collection metadata — columns: `embedding_dim`, `embedding_model` |
| `vec_{collectionId}` | Per-collection virtual table (`sqlite-vec` vec0) used for KNN search |
| `vec_chunks_fts` | FTS5 virtual table over `vec_chunks` for full-text keyword search |

### Collection Metadata on Disk

```
{projectPath}/.codebolt/vectordb/{collectionId}/
```

Each collection directory contains JSON files for collection info and settings.

### Database Migrations

Five migrations run in order:

1. `vec_documents` table
2. `vec_chunks` table
3. `vec_collections` table
4. FTS5 virtual table + triggers
5. `vec_migrations` tracking table

## Embedding

Embedding converts text into fixed-dimension vectors. The Vector DB routes embedding requests to one of several providers:

- **Local ONNX model** — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, dimension 384
- **Cloud providers** — OpenAI (dimension 1536), Voyage, and others

The provider and model are selected from project settings. Different models produce different embedding dimensions:

| Model | Dimension |
|---|---|
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (local) | 384 |
| OpenAI | 1536 |

The default dimension is **1536** when no model is explicitly configured.

## Document Processing Flow

When a document is indexed, the following steps execute:

1. `upsertDocument(uri, text)` is called.
2. The document type is detected from the URI file extension.
3. **If the extension is supported** (js, jsx, ts, tsx, py, rs, go, cpp, hpp, c, h, cs, rb, java, php, swift — 16 languages): AST-aware chunking via tree-sitter.
4. **Otherwise**: `TextSplitter` with language-specific separators.
5. Chunks are processed in **batches of 10** for embedding.
6. Each chunk is stored in `vec_chunks` and its embedding is inserted into the `vec0` virtual table.
7. Progress callbacks are emitted during processing.

### Indexing Events

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `indexing-started` | Processing begins for a document |
| `indexing-progress` | After each batch of chunks is embedded and stored |
| `indexing-completed` | All chunks processed successfully |
| `indexing-failed` | An error occurred during processing |

---

## Chunking Strategies

### TextSplitter

Used for unsupported file types and as a fallback.

- Configurable `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`
- Language-specific separator hierarchies (default, markdown, typescript, javascript, python, JSON)
- Splits by separators in priority order, respects token counts

### ASTChunker (tree-sitter)

Used for supported source code files:

**Supported extensions:** `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `py`, `rs`, `go`, `cpp`, `hpp`, `c`, `h`, `cs`, `rb`, `java`, `php`, `swift`

Behavior:

- Parses the file into an AST using tree-sitter
- Extracts function, class, and method definitions as individual chunks
- Splits large classes into a header chunk plus individual method chunks
- Preserves signature context for sub-chunks (the parent function/class signature is prepended)
- Falls back to `TextSplitter` if the parse fails

---

## Query Mechanics

When a query is executed:

1. The query text is embedded into a vector using the collection's configured model.
2. **KNN search** runs via `sqlite-vec`: finds the top-K most similar chunks by cosine distance.
3. **Optional hybrid search**: if enabled, an FTS5 BM25 keyword search runs in parallel.
4. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: merges KNN and BM25 result rankings into a combined score.
5. Results are grouped by document and sorted by the best chunk score within each document.
6. The response includes: document URI, relevance score, and matching text sections with line numbers.

### Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Max documents returned | 10 |
| Max chunks returned | 50 |

---

## Collection Settings

Each collection has a `VectorDbSettings` object that controls its behavior:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `embeddingModel` | Which embedding model to use |
| `embeddingProvider` | Local ONNX or a cloud provider |
| `chunkSize` | Number of tokens per chunk (default from project config) |
| `chunkOverlap` | Overlap in tokens between consecutive chunks |
| `searchMode` | `vector` (KNN only) or `hybrid` (KNN + BM25 via RRF) |
| `topK` | Default number of results to return |
| `minScore` | Minimum similarity threshold — results below this score are excluded |

## WebSocket Events

The Vector DB emits real-time events over WebSocket:

**Collection lifecycle:**
- `collection-created`
- `collection-updated`
- `collection-deleted`

**Document lifecycle:**
- `document-added`
- `document-deleted`

**Chunk lifecycle:**
- `chunks-added`
- `chunk-deleted`

**Indexing progress:**
- `indexing-started`
- `indexing-progress`
- `indexing-completed`
- `indexing-failed`

## SDK Reference

The `codebolt.vectordb` module exposes the following methods:

### Create a Collection

```javascript
const collection = await codebolt.vectordb.createCollection({
  name: "my-docs",
  embeddingModel: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  embeddingProvider: "local"
});
```

### Upsert a Document

```javascript
await codebolt.vectordb.upsertDocument(collectionId, {
  uri: "src/index.ts",
  text: fileContents
});
```

### Query Documents

```javascript
const results = await codebolt.vectordb.queryDocuments(collectionId, {
  query: "authentication middleware",
  topK: 5,
  searchMode: "hybrid"
});
```

### Delete a Document

```javascript
await codebolt.vectordb.deleteDocument(collectionId, "src/index.ts");
```

### Add a Chunk

```javascript
await codebolt.vectordb.addChunk(collectionId, {
  documentId: docId,
  chunkText: "function authenticate(req, res, next) { ... }",
  startPos: 0,
  endPos: 120
});
```

### Delete a Chunk

```javascript
await codebolt.vectordb.deleteChunk(collectionId, chunkId);
```
