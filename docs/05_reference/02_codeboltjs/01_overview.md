# codeboltjs Reference

The `codeboltjs` SDK is what agent authors use to write agents. It provides all `ctx.*` API methods, tool utilities, MCP bridging, and the type system. The entire Codebolt editor is controllable through it — filesystem, git, browser, terminal, LLM, memory, and 60+ more modules.

## Three access patterns

Every capability is available in three forms depending on who is consuming it:

| Pattern | How | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **API Format** | `import codebolt from '@codebolt/codeboltjs'` | You're writing a codeboltjs agent in TypeScript |
| **Tool Format** | Tool calls over Model Context Protocol | Your agent is model-native and not using codeboltjs directly |
| **CLI Format** | `execute_command` strings intercepted by the pseudo CLI registry | Your agent issues shell-style commands that the SDK routes to modules |

## What's in this section

| Section | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Direct API Access](./10_api-access/1-index.md) | Every `ctx.*` method — `fs`, `git`, `browser`, `memory`, `llm`, and 60+ more |
| [MCP Access](./11_mcp-access/1-index.md) | The same APIs exposed as MCP tools for non-codeboltjs agents |
| [Pseudo CLI](./pseudo_cli/index.md) | Command-shaped SDK access for intercepted `execute_command` calls |
| [Type Reference](./09_type-reference/index.md) | Full TypeScript types — codeboltjs classes, providers, shared types |
| [Utility Functions](./12_utility-functions/index.md) | `promptBuilder`, `llmOutputHandler`, `followupQuestionBuilder` |
