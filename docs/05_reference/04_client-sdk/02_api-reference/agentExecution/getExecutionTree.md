visualizing how agents spawned sub-agents during execution.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

## Returns

`Promise<AgentExecutionTree>` — A promise that resolves to the AgentExecutionTree structure

## Example

```typescript
import { CodeBoltClient } from '@codebolt/clientsdk';

const client = new CodeBoltClient();

const result = await client.agentExecution.getExecutionTree('threadId');
console.log(result);
```
