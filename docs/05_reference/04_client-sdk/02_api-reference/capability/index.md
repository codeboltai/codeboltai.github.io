### `createExecutor`

```typescript
client.capability.createExecutor(data: CreateCapabilityExecutorRequest): Promise<CapabilityExecutor>
```

Creates a new capability executor.

Registers an executor implementation that can handle invocations
of a specific capability.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `CreateCapabilityExecutorRequest` | Yes | The executor creation payload |

**Returns:** `Promise<CapabilityExecutor>` — A promise that resolves to the created CapabilityExecutor

### `getStats`

```typescript
client.capability.getStats(): Promise<CapabilityStats>
```

Retrieves aggregate statistics about capabilities.

Returns summary metrics about the capability system including
total counts, usage rates, and executor distribution.

_No parameters._

**Returns:** `Promise<CapabilityStats>` — A promise that resolves to the CapabilityStats object

[Full reference →](./getStats)

### `refresh`

```typescript
client.capability.refresh(data?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>
```

Refreshes the capability registry.
