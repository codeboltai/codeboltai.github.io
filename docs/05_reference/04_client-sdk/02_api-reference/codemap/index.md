### `delete`

```typescript
client.codemap.delete(codemapId: string): Promise<unknown>
```

### `getByPath`

```typescript
client.codemap.getByPath(params: CodemapByPathParams): Promise<Codemap[]>
```

Retrieves codemap entries by file path.

Looks up codemaps associated with a specific file path, returning
all structural information for that file.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params` | `CodemapByPathParams` | Yes | Query parameters including the file path to look up |

### `list`

```typescript
client.codemap.list(params?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Codemap[]>
```
