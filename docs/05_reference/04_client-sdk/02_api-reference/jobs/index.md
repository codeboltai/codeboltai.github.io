### `acceptSplitProposal`

```typescript
client.jobs.acceptSplitProposal(id: string, proposalId: string, data?: AcceptSplitProposalRequest): Promise<Job[]>
```

Accepts a split proposal, executing the job decomposition.

Approves the proposal and splits the original job into the proposed
sub-jobs. The original job's status may be updated to reflect the split.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the parent job |
| `proposalId` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the split proposal to accept |
| `data` | `AcceptSplitProposalRequest` | No | Optional acceptance parameters for additional context |

**Returns:** `Promise<Job[]>` — A promise that resolves to an array of the newly created sub- objects

### `addDependency`

```typescript
client.jobs.addDependency(id: string, data: AddDependencyRequest): Promise<void>
