### `cancelDownload`

```typescript

### `getEmbeddingSupportedLLMs`

```typescript
client.llm.getEmbeddingSupportedLLMs(): Promise<LLMProvider[]>
```

Retrieves LLM providers that support text embedding capabilities.

Filters providers to only those offering embedding models, which convert text into
numerical vectors for semantic search, similarity matching, and RAG workflows.

_No parameters._

**Returns:** `Promise<LLMProvider[]>` — A promise that resolves to an array of embedding-capable LLM providers

[Full reference →](./getEmbeddingSupportedLLMs)

```

Retrieves the LLM configuration for a specific local agent.

Returns the provider and model settings that have been configured for the given agent,
or the default configuration if no agent-specific override exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agentName` | `string` | Yes | The name of the agent whose LLM configuration to retrieve |

|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `LLMLocalAgentConfig` | Yes | The agent-specific LLM configuration |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when the agent configuration has been saved

[Full reference →](./setLocalAgent)

---

### `updateKey`

```typescript
client.llm.updateKey(data: LLMUpdateKeyRequest): Promise<unknown>

Downloads the most up-to-date pricing catalog from the remote source and persists it
locally. Call this periodically to ensure cost calculations reflect current rates.
