## Methods

### `acknowledgeMessage`

```typescript
client.mail.acknowledgeMessage(messageId: string): Promise<void>
```

Acknowledges receipt and processing of a message.

Signals that the receiving agent has processed the message content and taken
any required action. This is distinct from marking as read and indicates explicit
acknowledgment of the message's intent.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messageId` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the message to acknowledge |

**Returns:** `Promise<void>` — A promise that resolves when the acknowledgment has been recorded

### `checkReservationConflicts`

```typescript
client.mail.checkReservationConflicts(data: CheckReservationConflictsRequest): Promise<object>
```

Checks whether a proposed reservation would conflict with existing ones.

Validates that a resource is available before attempting to reserve it. Use this to
implement optimistic locking patterns where agents check availability before acting.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `CheckReservationConflictsRequest` | Yes | The conflict check payload |

**Returns:** `Promise<object>` — A promise that resolves to an object indicating whether a conflict exists

client.mail.createAgent(data: CreateMailAgentRequest): Promise<MailAgent>
```

Registers a new agent in the mail system.

its inbox, and participate in threaded conversations with other agents.
