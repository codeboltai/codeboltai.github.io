# `convertProposedJob`

```typescript
client.reviewMerge.convertProposedJob(id: string, proposedJobId: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>
```

| `proposedJobId` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the approved proposed job to convert |
| `data` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Optional additional data for the conversion |

## Returns

```typescript
import { CodeBoltClient } from '@codebolt/clientsdk';

const client = new CodeBoltClient();

const result = await client.reviewMerge.convertProposedJob('id', 'proposedJobId');
console.log(result);
```
