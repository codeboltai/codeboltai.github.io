hierarchies and dependencies.

## Parameters

## Returns

`Promise<ThreadGraphNode[]>` — A promise that resolves to an array of ThreadGraphNode objects

## Example

```typescript
import { CodeBoltClient } from '@codebolt/clientsdk';

const result = await client.threads.getGraph();
console.log(result);
```
