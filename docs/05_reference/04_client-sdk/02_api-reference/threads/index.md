### `advancedSearch`

```typescript
client.threads.advancedSearch(data: ThreadSearchRequest): Promise<Thread[]>
```

Performs an advanced search for threads based on multiple criteria.

Allows complex queries with filtering, sorting, and pagination to find
threads matching specific conditions. Use this for flexible thread discovery
and management operations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `ThreadSearchRequest` | Yes | The search request containing filter and query parameters |

**Returns:** `Promise<Thread[]>` — A promise that resolves to an array of matching Thread objects

---

### `autoUpdateName`

```typescript
client.threads.autoUpdateName(data: AutoUpdateNameRequest): Promise<void>
```

Automatically updates a thread's name based on its content.

Analyzes the thread's execution history, messages, and context to generate
an appropriate name that reflects its purpose and activity. This is useful
for maintaining descriptive thread labels without manual intervention.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `AutoUpdateNameRequest` | Yes | The request containing the thread ID to rename |

**Returns:** `Promise<void>` — A promise that resolves when the thread name has been updated

[Full reference →](./autoUpdateName)

---

### `bulkDelete`

```typescript
client.threads.bulkDelete(data: ThreadBulkDeleteRequest): Promise<void>
```

Deletes multiple threads in a single operation.

Removes the specified threads from the system in a bulk operation.

---

### `bulkUpdate`

```typescript
client.threads.bulkUpdate(data: ThreadBulkUpdateRequest): Promise<void>
```

Updates multiple threads in a single operation.

Performs bulk modifications across multiple threads simultaneously.

to apply the same changes to many threads.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `ThreadBulkUpdateRequest` | Yes | The bulk update request containing thread IDs and updates |

**Returns:** `Promise<void>` — A promise that resolves when all threads have been updated
