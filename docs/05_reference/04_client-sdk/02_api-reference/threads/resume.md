# `resume`

```typescript
client.threads.resume(threadId: string): Promise<void>

active state and continue processing.

## Parameters

## Returns

`Promise<void>` — A promise that resolves when the thread has been resumed

import { CodeBoltClient } from '@codebolt/clientsdk';

const client = new CodeBoltClient();

const result = await client.threads.resume('threadId');
console.log(result);
```
