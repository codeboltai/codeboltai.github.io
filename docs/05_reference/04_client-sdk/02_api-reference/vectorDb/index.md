## Methods

---

### `addChunks`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.addChunks(id: string, data: AddVectorChunksRequest): Promise<unknown>
```

Adds chunks to a vector collection.

Manually adds pre-chunked text segments to the collection with their
embeddings. This is useful when you have custom chunking logic or
want to add chunks without full document processing.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the target collection |
| `data` | `AddVectorChunksRequest` | Yes | The chunks to add with their embeddings and metadata |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when chunks have been added

### `addDocuments`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.addDocuments(id: string, data: AddVectorDocumentsRequest): Promise<unknown>
```

Adds documents to a vector collection.

Ingests new documents into the collection, automatically generating
embeddings and storing them for similarity search. Documents can include
text content and metadata for filtering.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the target collection |
| `data` | `AddVectorDocumentsRequest` | Yes | The documents to add along with their metadata |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when documents have been added

[Full reference →](./addDocuments)

---

### `createCollection`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.createCollection(data: CreateVectorCollectionRequest): Promise<VectorCollection>
```

Creates a new vector collection.

Initializes a new collection with specified configuration including
dimensionality, embedding model, and metadata settings. Collections
are used to store and manage vectors for similarity search operations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `CreateVectorCollectionRequest` | Yes | The collection configuration data including name, dimensions, and settings |

**Returns:** `Promise<VectorCollection>` — A promise that resolves to the created VectorCollection object

---

### `createIndex`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.createIndex(data: CreateVectorIndexRequest): Promise<unknown>
```

Creates a vector index for a collection.

Initializes an index structure to optimize similarity search
performance. Indexes enable fast nearest neighbor queries on
high-dimensional vectors and are essential for efficient retrieval.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data` | `CreateVectorIndexRequest` | Yes | The index creation configuration |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when the index has been created

[Full reference →](./createIndex)

### `deleteChunk`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.deleteChunk(id: string, chunkId: string): Promise<unknown>
```

Deletes a specific chunk from a vector collection.

Removes a single chunk by its unique identifier. This is useful for
granular cleanup when individual chunks need to be removed without
affecting other content in the collection.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

[Full reference →](./deleteChunk)

---

### `deleteCollection`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.deleteCollection(id: string): Promise<unknown>
```

Deletes a vector collection.

Permanently removes a collection and all its associated data including
documents, chunks, and index information. This operation cannot be undone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the collection to delete |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when the collection has been deleted

[Full reference →](./deleteCollection)

---

### `deleteDocuments`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.deleteDocuments(id: string, data?: DeleteVectorDocumentsRequest): Promise<unknown>
```

Deletes documents from a vector collection.

Removes specified documents from the collection based on provided
criteria such as document IDs or metadata filters. This operation
cleans up the collection and frees storage.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the collection |
| `data` | `DeleteVectorDocumentsRequest` | No | Optional deletion criteria for selecting documents to remove |

**Returns:** `Promise<unknown>` — A promise that resolves when documents have been deleted

[Full reference →](./deleteDocuments)

---

### `getChunks`

```typescript
client.vectorDb.getChunks(id: string, params?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<VectorChunk[]>
```

Retrieves chunks from a vector collection.

Fetches text chunks that were created when documents were processed.
Chunks are smaller segments of documents used for more granular
similarity search and retrieval operations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The unique identifier of the collection |
| `params` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Optional query parameters for filtering or pagination |
