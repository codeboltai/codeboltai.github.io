### Example 

```js 
// Navigate to a page
await codebolt.browser.goToPage("https://example.com");

// Wait for page to load
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

// Get a snapshot of the current page
const snapshotResult = await codebolt.browser.getSnapShot();
console.log('âœ… Snapshot taken:', snapshotResult);

// The snapshot contains comprehensive page state information
if (snapshotResult.success) {
    console.log('Snapshot data available for analysis');
    // Process the snapshot data as needed
}
```

### Explanation 

The `codebolt.browser.getSnapShot()` method captures a complete snapshot of the current page's state. This function returns a promise that resolves with comprehensive data about the page. The snapshot includes information about the DOM structure, styles, and other page properties at the moment the snapshot is taken. Unlike a screenshot which captures only the visual representation, a snapshot contains structural data that can be used for detailed analysis, testing, debugging, or to restore the page state at a later time. This is particularly useful in automated testing scenarios and web analysis workflows.
