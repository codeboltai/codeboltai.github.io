### Example

```js
// Wait for connection to be established
await codebolt.waitForConnection();

// Open a new page in the browser
const newPageResult = await codebolt.browser.newPage();
console.log('âœ… New page created:', newPageResult);

// Navigate to a specific URL after creating the page
await codebolt.browser.goToPage('https://example.com');
```

### Explanation

The `codebolt.browser.newPage()` function creates a new browser tab or window. This function returns a promise that resolves when the new page is successfully created. It's typically used at the beginning of browser automation workflows to initialize a fresh browsing context. The function is useful in web automation, testing, and multi-page navigation scenarios where you need to interact with multiple pages simultaneously or start with a clean browser state.
