# Tools

Codebolt supports writing your own custom Model Control Protocol (MCP) tools. These custom tools allow you to extend Codebolt's functionality by creating specialized actions that AI agents can perform. You can define your own tool interfaces, implement their functionality, and make them available for agents to use when solving tasks.

Custom MCP tools are powerful for:
- Integrating with external services and APIs
- Creating domain-specific functionality for your projects
- Automating repetitive tasks with specialized tools
- Building workflow-specific capabilities
