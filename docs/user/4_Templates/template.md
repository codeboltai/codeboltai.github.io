# Templates

Codebolt provides a library of pre-built project templates to help you get started quickly with popular frameworks and languages. These templates come pre-configured with recommended settings, folder structures, and boilerplate code, allowing you to dive right into building your application.

## Benefits of Using Templates

- **Faster Project Setup**: Templates eliminate the need to manually configure your project from scratch. With just a few clicks, you can have a working project ready to go.

- **Best Practices**: Templates follow industry best practices and conventions for the selected framework or language. This ensures your project starts off on the right foot with a clean and organized structure.
