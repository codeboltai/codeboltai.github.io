# Template

The Template  is designed to facilitate the quick creation of new projects with predefined setups for popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries. By using templates, developers can skip the repetitive tasks involved in setting up project configurations and can jumpstart their work with an organized structure. The available templates include setups for React, Express, Next.js, and an Empty project option.

### Template Options
* React: Sets up a new React app with ES6+, JSX, and Webpack or Vite. Essential dependencies and folder structure are pre-configured. Start quickly by selecting the React template.

* Express: Creates a back-end Express project for RESTful APIs, with basic middleware and error handling. Provides a suitable structure for server-side development; select Express to get started.

* Next.js: Initializes a Next.js app with routing, page, and API setup. Perfect for full-stack development; choose Next.js to begin.

* Empty: A minimal template with only essential files. Ideal for custom setups; use Empty to create a basic project foundation.

**Each template is selectable for quick project setup!**
