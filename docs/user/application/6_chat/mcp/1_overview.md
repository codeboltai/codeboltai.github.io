# MCP Tools Overview

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services. In Codebolt, MCP tools extend the AI's capabilities beyond text generation to include real-world actions and integrations.

## Core Concepts

### Tools
- **External Integrations**: Connect AI to databases, APIs, and services
- **Action Capabilities**: Perform operations beyond code generation
- **Real-time Data**: Access live information and current system states
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Tools can send data back to the AI

### Resources
- **File Access**: Read and modify files in your project
- **Database Connections**: Query and update database records
- **API Endpoints**: Interact with web services and REST APIs
- **System Information**: Access system metrics and configurations

### Prompts
- **Dynamic Context**: Generate contextual prompts based on current state
- **Tool-Specific**: Specialized prompts for different tool types
- **User Preferences**: Customize prompts based on your workflow
- **Adaptive Responses**: Prompts that evolve with your project

## Available MCP Tools

### Development Tools
- **Git Integration**: Commit, push, pull, and manage repositories
- **Package Managers**: Install and manage dependencies (npm, pip, etc.)
- **Build Systems**: Execute build scripts and deployment processes
- **Testing Frameworks**: Run tests and generate coverage reports

### Database Tools
- **SQL Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite connections
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Redis integrations
- **Query Builder**: Visual query construction and execution
- **Schema Management**: Database migration and schema updates

### API Integration Tools
- **REST Clients**: HTTP requests with authentication
- **GraphQL**: Query and mutation operations
- **Webhook Management**: Set up and manage webhook endpoints
- **API Documentation**: Generate and maintain API docs

### File System Tools
- **File Operations**: Advanced file manipulation beyond basic editor functions
- **Archive Management**: Create and extract ZIP, TAR files
- **File Synchronization**: Sync files between different locations
- **Permission Management**: Handle file and folder permissions

### Cloud Services
- **AWS Integration**: EC2, S3, Lambda, and other AWS services
- **Google Cloud**: GCP service integrations
- **Azure Services**: Microsoft Azure tool connections
- **Container Management**: Docker and Kubernetes operations

### Monitoring & Analytics
- **Log Analysis**: Parse and analyze application logs
- **Performance Metrics**: System and application performance data
- **Error Tracking**: Integration with error monitoring services
- **Usage Analytics**: Track application usage patterns

## Benefits of MCP Tools

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
- **Beyond Code**: AI can perform actual operations, not just suggest code
- **Context Awareness**: Tools provide real-time context about your environment
- **Automated Workflows**: Chain tools together for complex operations
- **Reduced Manual Work**: AI handles routine tasks automatically

### Improved Development Experience
- **Unified Interface**: Access all tools through the chat interface
- **Natural Language**: Control tools using natural language commands
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI suggests relevant tools based on context
- **Error Handling**: Intelligent error recovery and suggestions

### Extensibility
- **Custom Tools**: Create your own MCP tools for specific needs
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily add new capabilities
- **Team Sharing**: Share custom tools with your development team
- **Marketplace**: Access community-developed tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Codebolt Editor installed and configured
- Active AI model subscription
- Necessary API keys for external services
- Basic understanding of your development environment

### Quick Setup
1. **Enable MCP Tools**: Activate MCP in your Codebolt settings
2. **Configure Credentials**: Add API keys and connection strings
3. **Test Connection**: Verify tools are working correctly
4. **Explore Examples**: Try built-in tool examples

### Best Practices
- **Security First**: Never share API keys or sensitive credentials
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic tools before moving to complex integrations
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test tools in development before production use
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of tool usage and costs
