# Layouts

Codebolt provides three layout options to suit different development needs and preferences:

1. **Basic**: This layout is ideal when you want to focus on updating your app through chat interactions without seeing the code. It provides a streamlined interface for making changes to your app using natural language conversations.

2. **Dev**: The Dev layout is designed for basic development tasks. It includes a chat interface, a code editor, and a preview pane. This layout allows you to have conversations with the AI, make code changes, and see the results in real-time.

3. **Power Dev**: The Power Dev layout is tailored for advanced development scenarios. In addition to the features provided in the Dev layout, it also includes a terminal, console, and debugging tools. This layout gives you full control over your development environment, enabling you to perform complex tasks and troubleshoot issues effectively.

Choose the layout that best fits your development style and requirements. The Basic layout is perfect for quick updates and iterations, while the Dev and Power Dev layouts offer progressively more powerful tools for comprehensive development workflows.
