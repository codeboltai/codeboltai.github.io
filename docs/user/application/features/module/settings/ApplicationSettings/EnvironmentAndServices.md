### Environment and Services

The **Environment and Services** section allows you to configure and manage the runtime environment and external services for your applications. This is particularly useful when working with projects that require specific language runtimes or depend on external services.

### Key features include

#### Language Runtimes
 You can verify the presence of required language runtimes, such as Python, Node.js, or Java. This ensures that your application has the necessary runtime environment to execute properly.

####  External Service Integration
  You can configure connections to various external services that your application may rely on. Some commonly used services include:
   - Redis
   - PostgreSQL
   - MongoDB

   By providing the necessary connection URLs or configuration details, you can seamlessly integrate these services into your application.
