![Create Capability](/productImages/agent_extensions/capability.png)

A Capability is a versioned, reusable unit of agent behaviour with defined inputs and outputs. Agents invoke capabilities during task execution to perform specific, well-scoped operations — without re-implementing the same logic in every agent.

Open via: **Agents dropdown → Capabilities**

## Capability types

Capabilities have a `type` field that classifies their purpose:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `skill` | A user-invocable behaviour, often available via slash command |
| `power` | A more complex automation, typically used internally by agents |
| `talent` | A specialised capability for a specific domain or task |

Custom types can be registered and handled by a matching executor.

## Where capabilities live

Codebolt discovers capabilities from three locations, in priority order:

| Source | Path | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | `.codebolt/capabilities/{name}/` | This project only |
| **Global** | `~/.codebolt/capabilities/{name}/` | All projects on this machine |
| **Built-in** | Shipped with Codebolt | Always available |

## Capability configuration

Each capability directory contains a `capability.yaml`:

```yaml
name: summarise-changes
type: skill
version: 1.0.0
description: Summarises the changes in a git diff
author: yourname
tags: [git, summarisation]
inputs:
  - name: diff
    type: string
    required: true
    description: The git diff to summarise
outputs:
  - name: summary
    type: string
    description: Human-readable summary of the changes
```

## The Capabilities panel

The panel has three tabs:

### Capabilities tab
Lists all discovered capabilities with their name, type, version, and source. Use the **type filter** and **search bar** to narrow the list. Click **Refresh** to re-scan the filesystem after adding a new capability.

### Skills tab
Shows capabilities of type `skill` from the marketplace. Browse, search by name or author, and download skills directly into your global capabilities directory.

### Executors tab
Shows the executor runtimes available for running capabilities. See [Executors](./06_executors.md) for details.

## How agents invoke capabilities

Agents call capabilities through the Capability Manager. The call includes:
- The capability name and version
- Input values
- The current thread ID (so the capability has conversation context)

The Capability Manager routes the call to the appropriate executor, waits for the result, and returns it to the agent. Execution is tracked with the agent's run ID for observability.
